# ransomwares-simulator
A ransomware simulator is a tool used to mimic the behavior of ransomware attacks in a controlled environment to test and evaluate the effectiveness of security measures without causing actual harm.
# Pandora Ransomware Simulator

Pandora is a ransomware simulation tool designed for educational and testing purposes. This project allows users to simulate ransomware attacks in a controlled environment, encrypting files and offering a GUI for decryption using a specific key.

## Features
- **File Encryption**: Encrypt files using a custom algorithm.
- **File Decryption**: Decrypt the encrypted files with the correct decryption key.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: A user-friendly interface for decryption.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pandora-ransomware-simulator.git
   cd pandora-ransomware-simulator

   cd pandora-ransomware-simulator
Install required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Encryption
To encrypt your files, use the encr.py script:

bash
Copy code
python encr.py
Decryption
To decrypt files, you can use either the dec.py script or the GUI.

Command-line Decryption
bash
Copy code
python dec.py
GUI Decryption
Run the GUI:

bash
Copy code
python gui.py
or

bash
Copy code
python pandora_gui.py
The GUI will allow you to enter the decryption key and unlock your files.

Files
encr.py: Handles file encryption.
dec.py: Handles file decryption.
gui.py: Basic GUI for decryption.
pandora_gui.py: Extended GUI with additional features for the decryption process.
